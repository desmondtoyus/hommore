                                Hommore is the first mobile-optimized website in Los Angeles that connects homeless and low-income residents with critical and life-saving resources nearby. Focusing on basic services such as food, shelter, medical care, and technology access, Hommore utilizes cutting-edge technology to stream the most updated information to the people who need it most. Hommore was designed with three user groups in mind: 1) A growing population of low-income Angelenos who rely on mobile technology to meet their basic needs, 2) Service providers who can use real-time data to direct clients in need, and 3) Everyday people who can use this information as a way to help refer Los Angelesâ€™ homeless population to a social service agency nearby.
